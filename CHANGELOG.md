# Changelog

All notable changes to Cairn are documented here. Cairn uses date-based versioning (CalVer)
`YYYY.0M[.PATCH]`. This is the version of the language + reference compiler + standard library +
registry/constraint packs as a bundle, and is a separate axis from the Minecraft target version.

## 2026.06 (draft)

Initial public design specification. The language is being designed in the open; no reference
compiler exists yet.

- Core model: declare intent, the compiler resolves blockstate, coordinates, and physics.
- Three-layer IR (Intent → Semantic/Theme → block-array pivot), phase-ordered evaluation.
- Syntax: leading keyword + mandatory `key=value`; selectors; optional headers (`@cairn`,
  `@requires`, `@intended_targets`).
- Blockstate: derive-by-default with override-promotion; `intent_state` / `resolved_state`.
- Materials & themes: `mat_slot` slots, two-tier canonical vocabulary, CSS-like theme binding.
- Entities: first-class decoration entities plus a generic `spawn`; anchor conventions.
- Components, editing (stable addresses + patch grammar), and multi-building `site` placement.
- Versioning & editions: `(edition, version)` compile-time target; recompile-don't-transcode;
  fail-loud with nearest-valid suggestions; DataVersion as the canonical ordering key (absorbs
  Minecraft's move to date-based versions); provenance + lockfile.
- Java/Bedrock from one source via per-edition backends and a QC-free safe cell library.
- Redstone: logical sub-language (signal graph → synthesis → place-and-route), combinational plus
  curated sequential macros; verification by a headless tick simulator.
- Ecosystem interop: export to common formats; import as faithful transliteration with LLM lift.
- Evaluation: headless geometry/redstone simulator drives quantitative spec iteration.
