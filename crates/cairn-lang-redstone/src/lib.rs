//! Redstone for Cairn.
//!
//! Synthesizes a signal-graph (Logic IR) into a netlist, places and routes the netlist into a
//! voxel circuit, and verifies it with a headless per-tick simulator. The cell library is
//! three-tier (logical cell → edition cell → physical tile) so an edition difference is
//! confined to the library.
