//! Routed Placement IR → delayed Placement IR lowering (delay insertion).
//!
//! Stage 3 of the five-stage pipeline `spec/redstone` "Place-and-route"
//! lays out. Rebuilds every net's routed tree (the routing pass stores
//! only the summed `wire_length`; the trees are cheap to rebuild
//! and would bloat the JSON if stored) and rewrites every cell's
//! [`crate::placement_ir::PlacedCellNode::local_delay_ticks`] from `None`
//! to `Some(base delay + implicit buffer ticks)`:
//!
//! - **Base delay** is the cell's
//!   [`crate::edition_netlist_ir::EditionCell::base_delay_ticks`]; an
//!   actuator pad has none.
//! - **Implicit buffer repeaters** are counted per driving net, not per
//!   driver: two ports reading one signal are fed by one strand of dust
//!   and by the repeaters standing on it. Dust loses one unit of signal
//!   per block from strength 15, so `repeater_sites` stands a
//!   repeater, worth [`BUFFER_REPEATER_TICKS`], after at most
//!   `DUST_ATTENUATION_LIMIT` blocks of dust since the last block that
//!   restored strength — on a straight run from a fresh source in
//!   place of every 16th block, `floor((s - 1) / 16)` of them over a
//!   segment of `s` steps, and earlier where the coord there turns,
//!   climbs or forks, which a repeater cannot carry a signal through.
//!
//!   That last block is not always the start of the net. A cell that
//!   passes on the strength it reads (a Bedrock OR, a Java comparator
//!   AND) is not a strand of dust — its body stands between the wire
//!   into it and the wire out — but it restores nothing, so for the
//!   limit the two wires count as one run, and a repeater that run
//!   needs can land on either side of the cell.
//!
//! A segment is the *routed* path from the net's source to the sink
//! (`route_to`), not the Manhattan distance: the two differ whenever the
//! wire goes round something, and counting against the route is what
//! lets stage 4 put every buffer this stage paid for onto the dust it
//! refreshes. A cell is charged for the repeaters its segment passes
//! through, and stage 4 gives those same repeaters their coords. Each
//! pass builds its own `RepeaterSites` by running the same
//! deterministic function over its own rebuilt trees and the same
//! `ir.cells`, so the ticks one charges and the blocks the other lays
//! land on the same set as long as nothing between them moves a cell.
//! Nothing asserts it at runtime; `crossing.rs`'s proptest is what
//! checks the two describe one circuit.
//!
//! **`local_delay_ticks` is a local wire cost, not an arrival time.** It
//! sums the buffers on every net feeding the cell, and it is the number
//! stage 4 is held to: `local_delay_ticks - base_delay_ticks` equals
//! [`BUFFER_REPEATER_TICKS`] per block in the cell's *deduplicated*
//! `buffer_coords` — the attribution list may name a coord twice, the
//! count may not. An arrival time would
//! take the max over those nets and add the arrival of each upstream
//! driver, so the two part company whenever more than one incoming net
//! carries a buffer or any driver is itself a cell. Nothing in this crate
//! computes an arrival time, and nothing should read this field as one —
//! `assert latency(...)` (`spec/redstone` "Verification") is a path
//! latency for the simulator pass to evaluate.
//!
//! `E_ATTENUATION_LIMIT` fires when a single segment's routed length
//! exceeds the v1 sanity cap [`MAX_ATTENUATION_SEGMENT`]. It also fires
//! when a run of dust would pass the attenuation limit — counted from
//! the last block that restored strength, or within a cell's smaller
//! budget — and no coord on it can hold a repeater close enough. Failed
//! scopes are elided so a partial `local_delay_ticks`
//! set never reaches a downstream reader.
//!
//! The pass is one `PlacementPhase::delay` transition per cell; no new
//! IR type. `--stage route` JSON keeps every key it had, gains
//! `local_delay_ticks` after `wire_length`, and its `stage` tag moves
//! from `route` to `delay`.
